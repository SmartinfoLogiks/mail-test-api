# Mail Test API

Quick PHP Mail Testing API for verifying and checking email configurations and testing.

While working many times we have to check EMail sending capabilities and if the EMail details with us are actually working. Sending a quick mail using the same is usually the best way, but then we have to configure and setup etc. To save my time and effort in checking each time a situation like this comes arround, I created this project.

## Installation
+ Download the master.zip
+ Unzip into any folder in PHP Server's DOCROOT folder such that the link is http://weblink.com/mailtest/
+ Try hitting the link formed above. The program will tell you the next steps :-)


Thank you
